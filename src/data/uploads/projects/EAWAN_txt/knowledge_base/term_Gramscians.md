*   Within the context of the story, the "Gramscians" serve as a cautionary tale. They represent the potential dangers and ethical pitfalls of unchecked experimentation. Their existence highlights the risks associated with procedures that prioritize scientific advancement over individual well-being. They are a symbol of past wrongs.

**## Significance**

It underscores the ethical debate surrounding the experimental procedures and raises questions about informed consent and the long-term consequences of such interventions. It serves as a major obstacle to Edie Ann receiving the implants.

**## Relationships**

*   **Linda:** Linda's connection to the "Gramscians" is the most significant. Her upbringing and exposure to their suffering have deeply impacted her, making her fiercely protective of Edie Ann. Her memories of the Gramscians directly influence her decisions and create conflict in the narrative.
