"I need you to do me a service," Hugh said when I walked into our bedroom.

"Well, sir, yes, sir. Let me rinse off first. I smell like a horse rolled in an oil spill," I said with a smile and started unhooking my overalls and taking off my shirt.

"That's not what I meant," Hugh replied gruffly and stood up from our over-sized bed leaving half a pile of unfolded towels.

"You mean it wasn't what you meant, but now that the idea is out there..." I let my voice trail off with mischievous sparkles in my eyes.

"That's not what I meant, BUT after we talk about work, if you still want to, then we can certainly talk about play," he replied with the start of a smile slipping past his solemn countenance. Then I let my overalls fall to the floor revealing my boxers and excitement.

"You are in a good mood today," Hugh commented.

"Today was a good day at the shop. I finished the restoration of a classic truck, repaired a couple of clocks, and got the main work floor ready for the bi-plane coming in tomorrow. Easy, but physical, just like me," I teased.

"We still need to talk," Hugh reminded me. He was still dressed for the office, but his hair was a mess and his navy, monogrammed shirt was starting to wrinkle while his Sinclair burgundy sport coat was draped haphazardly across the desk and chair.

"I still have time for a shower first?" I asked, grease on my nose, idontknowwhat caked in my hair and something yellow on my elbow. What did I touch that was yellow?

"Of course, you get cleaned up and I will keep working on the laundry. Then we can talk," Hugh said then turned on the news and returned to folding the basket of towels on the bed while senators argued about the morality and economic impact of activating and releasing the government's [cyborganic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgxjuzyT_xHvY7aai1N4RrZRXKDA76-W/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgxjuzyT_xHvY7aai1N4RrZRXKDA76-W/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true") stockpile of over a million individuals along with enhanced plants and animals.

"You know, I could get even cleaner with an extra set of hands. " I poked my head out of the bathroom to offer.

"No, I don't think that you would. Go on," Hugh said.

"Okay, but I am not putting clothes back on so it better be a conversation we can have naked," I told him.

"Come give me a kiss, then go take your shower," Hugh said.

He still looked conflicted to me, but sometimes Hugh gets stuck and needs help remembering that there is more to life. So I rushed over, grabbed my husband by the back of his hair pulling his head back and jaw open and kissed him passionately keeping a tight grip while pinning his body against mine and slowly, firmly raking my nails across his back. Then after one even tighter squeeze, I let him go. Hugh gasped for breath as I started to walk away.

The hot water sizzled into my skin and I tensed, but with a few slow breaths, I was able to lean into the flow and let the tension in my muscles wash down the drain. I never had anything like this growing up in San Paulo. My brother Shelby and I mostly used wipes. Showers were always lukewarm at best. I would rather hurt for a few seconds than miss out on hot water now that I have it. Ten minutes later I was out with sex brain at least somewhat under control. I checked in the mirror to make sure I got all of the yellow off from the back of my arm and thought "That's not a bad-looking guy over there. I'd do him." Then smiled at my reflection. I'm not tall, but I am tall enough. I have muscles from the work I do. They'd be bigger if some of that work was at a gym, or if I had Hugh's genetic enhancements, but I'm not weak. My brown hair is almost ready for a trim, but it isn't in my eyes so it can wait til next week. Hugh slipped in with a towel as I finished my assessment and started drying me off.

"Okay, now I'm suspicious. What's going on?" I asked.

"I need your help. There's a problem at work," he said plainly with an expression I could not read.

"What kind of problem?" I asked trying to keep my voice neutral despite my eyes narrowing.

"The Twist Drive controller broke during shipping," Hugh said in a sigh and looked away.

"Oh, honey, that's terrible. I bet the tech team is pulling their hair out trying to fix it. Good luck with that," I told him with mock sincerity.

"They have. It did not help. I really tried not to bring this to you, I promise," Hugh pleaded.

"Fine, have it delivered to my shop and I will take a look at it," I told him.

When he started to open his mouth I continued to say, "No, I told you when I built it, I don't do house calls, unless those houses are on Earth."

"I'm sorry, I need you to go there," he told me.

"I don't work for you, Hugh. I have my own business, restoring antiques." I reminded him, "I love what I do, people appreciate my work and they don't turn around and break the things I just fixed."

"I know. I know, I'm sorry," Hugh continued apologizing. "It's just this time," he started to say, but I cut him off.

"No. I have it in writing that you would never ask me to leave Earth to work on the Twist Drive," I reminded him, "I took one field trip to the moon in elementary school and I was miserable the entire time. I banged into everything and when I wasn't giving myself bruises or a concussion, I was nauseous. I have no interest in going to the edge of the solar system to be miserable doing grueling work, when I could be home doing things I actually enjoy."

"It's not at the edge," Hugh offered unhelpfully, "It is just past Neptune."

"Close enough," I glared.

"I spent ninety-seven days making sure that every piece of that dark matter manipulator of yours was completely on spec. I remodeled my workshop for that project," I reminded him.

"Because no one can match your eye for details," Hugh supplied.

As I looked him in the eyes, the [news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PucOnOVM4yX4e69AhqQFjmBZRkqgSOc/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true "https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PucOnOVM4yX4e69AhqQFjmBZRkqgSOc/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true") broke in with, "ROBOTS RIOT AT VITAL SOUTH AMERICAN WATER STATION.

Zis power feed was damaged. Sent Emergency Responders are on-site, the condition of the sentient, artificial intelligence is unknown at..." until Hugh turned the volume down.

"I turned down a chance to help restore the only authenticated Thomas Nash lantern clock because my hands were full of nanocalipers going over every square micron of your Twist Drive," I said, then added, "I still can't find half of my woodworking tools."

"I know, and that clock was historic. It was. It is, but the Twist Drive will be revolutionary," Hugh countered.

"Hypothetically," I replied. Everything Hugh thinks of is obviously the most important thing ever. The rest of creation deals solely in trifles.

"Theoretically," he corrected. "And I am so close to proving my theory. The control mechanism will work. I know it," he added, "Rapid, direct flights from Station One to Neptune Station are rare and usually booked well in advance, but space opened up at the last minute. You were already done building it. It was kismet, I thought."

"You subjected a delicate mechanism to extreme forces and now it doesn't work. If only you had listened when someone told you that the force of acceleration on a rapid delivery ship was too high, you wouldn't be standing here fiddling with your hair," I told him.

"Carroll," Hugh said and took a breath.

"Don't Carroll me!" I shot back at him.

Hugh started to respond when Linda walked into the bedroom with her arms full of flowers, their sweet fragrance overpowering the steamy bathroom air.

She looked back and forth between us, her dark hair dancing side to side and slid a large vase onto the desk.

"What is going on here?" she asked

Hugh started to open his mouth when I jumped in. "I will tell you what's happening here. Your husband is secretly a sadist, hates me and wants me gone," I informed her and continued drying off.

Hugh pulled back, eyes wide, hand in his hair again and started explaining. "Our husband has it all wrong Linda. You know I love Carroll. I don't want him to leave, but I need him," he pleaded.

Linda let the silence breathe a beat or two, but was interrupted when the quiet news program was replaced by a loud ad for Sol Prime, "Sol Prime, by [Sol Inc](http://The System Runs on Sol "http://The System Runs on Sol"). brings the solar system to your doorstep! The system runs on Sol!"

Then she started shaking her head and telling Hugh, "I said you would be better off hiring a team of techs."

"I knew he was going to do this," I told her with an accusing stare at Hugh.

"It is only one part. I just need the control mechanism. Everything else is being built on-site. I promise not to..." I said mocking Hugh's baritone.

"I warned you," Linda reminded Hugh, "Carroll closed his shop for months to build that for you. I told you he would not be happy. And that you have no right to ask him to go so far."

"But I need HIM," Hugh pleaded. "He's the only one I can trust and rely on to fix the Twist Drive," he told her.

"You are incredibly lucky to have all the work he already did," Linda told him.

"I know," Hugh said solemnly. Hugh was several centimeters taller than Linda, but with his head hung low and shoulders drooped she seemed to tower over him.

"Just hire someone. I'm sure there is someone out there you could find," she told him.

Hugh kept his eyes on Linda, but edged closer to me with each of his words, "But where else could I find someone as smart, handsome, talented, loving and generous to take his place?"

"His poor planning is not my emergency," I told her. To Hugh, I said, "And, I see what you are doing."

"Me too," said Linda, "and therefore my hands are tied. If you want to try to convince Carroll to go, you'll have to do it at Luigi's."

I considered this for a moment and said, "I'll grab my camera.”

Most people only eat one meal a week, Sunday dinner, in San Paulo. My parents weren't even consistent about that. The Colors, tubes of nutrient dense paste with a hunger suppressant are what I grew up on.

Whenever I go out and eat, I like to take a picture to send with the description of the food to everyone back home, not to brag, my friends and followers would be genuinely upset if I didn't share the experience in detail.

"But," Hugh started to say.

"Luigi's," Linda repeated.

"B-"

"Luigi's!" Linda and I chimed together.

"Do you have any idea how expensive a table at Luigi's is?" Hugh countered.

"Hmm, do I know how much Luigi's costs?" I made a show of thinking. "Nope, can't say that I do."

"That's because you have never paid for it," Hugh grumbled under his breath. "Besides, we might need a reservation for Luigi's," Hugh argued.

I was already scrambling to get dressed so I ignored him.

Linda made us each special clothes that we wore when we needed to dress up. Mine were always hung in my wardrobe, but sometimes Linda would add or replace pieces without letting me know. My outfit today was an iridescent blue-green pair of pants with matching vest, a pale yellow shirt, a thin, shiny black belt, and black Oxfords shined to a mirrored finish, topped with a spider-silk blazer covered in rain clouds.

Linda pointed out, "He almost always has a private room available, besides I have been dreaming of trying [The Experience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvbbrT9UgjmcgaVXcNJY1eMrIH8IqB7P/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvbbrT9UgjmcgaVXcNJY1eMrIH8IqB7P/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=115625857347378972149&rtpof=true&sd=true") since Carroll's birthday."

"The Experience?!" Hugh's eyes bugged out.

"Linda, do you know how much a 14-course, gourmet tasting experience at Luigi's costs?" I asked in a terrible imitation of Hugh's voice.

"With wine," she said, cocked her head to the side and looked up as if doing the math. "Yes, I think it works out to about one minute and 42 seconds of Hugh whining."

"Wh-" Hugh started to exclaim.

"And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Times up." Linda declared, "Oh look, Carroll, our meals are paid for. Let's get ready."

I smiled my Infectious Smile™ and Hugh, resigned, started to change his shirt.

"You know, your contagious smile isn't going to work on me every time," Hugh muttered.

"Infectious Smile™!" I reminded him, beaming. Linda stifled a laugh and broke into a wide grin.

I turned back to see Hugh smiling as well.
